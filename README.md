OpenTable Front-End Test
========================

Thanks for taking the time to complete our front-end test. Please spend no more than 2-2Â½ hours on this application. Please reach out to us if you have any questions about the test.


## The task

We would like you to build a web application that allows a user to select dishes for two diners from a supplied menu at a restaurant that has some rules for what an acceptable order is.

We have prepared a basic application structure for you using React and Webpack. Please add any additional libraries that you think are suitable, for example for CSS and testing.

The menu data is provided in `menu-data.json` and the application is in `src/App.js`.

Please write as clean and maintainable code as possible, and make sure that it's covered by test cases.


## Rules

This restaurant unfortunately has a number of rules about the meals that can be ordered.

- Each person must have at least two courses, one of which must be a main.
- Each diner cannot have more than one of the same course.
- There is only one piece of cheesecake left.
- Pierre the snobby waiter will not let you have prawn cocktail and salmon fillet in the same meal.


## Acceptance criteria

- The total bill amount is displayed when at least one dish has been selected.
- An error message is displayed when I try to select an invalid menu combination.


## Submission

Please submit your program either by sending a zip file or by providing a link to a repository, dropbox, etc to your point of contact at OpenTable.
